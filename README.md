## Fault Prediction in Software Defined Networks (FPSDN)

This project provides a robust framework for extracting specifications from real-world Software Defined Network (SDN) datasets using [DyNetKAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10035) and 
automatically identifying potential faulty
behaviors within these networks. Our goal is to enhance the reliability and efficiency of SDNs by facilitating detailed analysis and troubleshooting in a fully automated manner.
