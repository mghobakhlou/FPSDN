The approach employed in this research includes an initial step where the network is simulated to create log files. Following that, these log files go through an extensive pre-processing stage in which their size is decreased, and the network structure (topology) is extracted. This entire procedure ultimately results in the development of a comprehensive specification for DyNetKAT, which is accomplished by making use of the pre-processed log files.
