(** {2 Type} *)

(** the type of a bit string. AF: the table [H] represents a bitvector [v] where
    [v_i]=1 iff [(i, ())] is in [H]. Note that bit strings are interpreted left 
    to right as highest bit to lowest bit. So the string 110 is the binary
    representation of 6 and (100)_0 = 0 whereas (100)_2 = 1 *)
